                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    We're building the Huly MetaBrain, a dynamic "second brain" for your team powered by intelligent AI
                    assistants. Take a look at how our first AI assistant — Hulia — will help you work more
                    productively.

                    Meet Hulia - Huly's first AI assistant
                </h2>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    With our latest release, we’re excited to introduce Hulia, Huly’s first AI assistant. You’ll meet
                    Hulia when you join a video call in your Huly virtual office, where she’ll join the meeting to
                    quietly transcribe the conversation in real time. Hulia’s meeting transcriptions are just the first
                    implementation of a much larger concept we’re developing: the Huly MetaBrain, a dynamic “second
                    brain” for your team powered by intelligent AI assistants. (Watch a preview here!)
                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    Soon, Hulia will be able to do much more than simply listen and transcribe what she hears. After
                    releasing this early implementation, we’re now working to fine-tune our transcription technology for
                    better accuracy, building an incredible capacity for voice recognition allowing for even more
                    powerful AI capabilities. Hulia will be able to:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mb-4">
                    <li class="list-group-item bg-black text-white">
                        Create meeting summaries: Generate concise, organized summaries of key points discussed in the
                        meeting.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item bg-black text-white">
                        Turn discussions into action: Automatically create tasks, draft documents, and assign action
                        items based on the meeting content.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    You’ll be able to see detailed meeting notes, actionable tasks assigned to the right people, and
                    relevant documents drafted — and this is only the beginning. Hulia’s capabilities will evolve to
                    perform these actions in real time, allowing teams to leave meetings with a clear, immediate sense
                    of direction without scrambling to recall what was said.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    Hulia’s assistance will go beyond meetings. With a broad awareness of workspace activity, Hulia will
                    be able to perform various useful tasks, such as:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mb-4">
                    <li class="list-group-item bg-black text-white">
                        Flagging and resolving ambiguities and contradictions in communication
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item bg-black text-white">
                        Generating action items, documents and tasks based on chat correspondence
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item bg-black text-white">
                        Suggesting prioritization of tasks to even out the team workload
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item bg-black text-white">
                        Consolidating duplicate or redundant tasks
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    To execute these actions, Hulia will require a sort of semi-omniscience — and understanding of the
                    world (your Huly world) around her, and the ability to take action on her own accord.

                    Challenges and solutions
                </h2>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    Naturally, providing broad workspace access to an AI assistant presents several challenges. Among
                    our 40,000 cloud workspaces, many teams are handling important sensitive data, and security is an
                    understandable concern for users who are grappling with a new world of trend-followers who have
                    rushed towards gimicky AI integrations without thorough consideration of privacy and control.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    Let’s explore how our team is approaching some of these challenges:
                </p>
                <h3 class="display-6 fw-bold mb-4">
                    1. Permission-based access and encryption
                </h3>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    AI meeting transcriptions in Huly are currently visible to all workspace members as we encourage
                    users to try it out and share feedback during this earliest phase of implementation. Next, our focus
                    shifts toward delivering permissions-based access for virtual office spaces, making transcriptions
                    only visible to those with access to the meeting room.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    This means that Hulia won’t be able to eavesdrop on a private conversation between you and your
                    coworker about your boss and accidentally generate a “Do better” action item in you boss’s personal
                    planner. You can rest assured that even within your shared workspace, Hulia will only have access to
                    the information she’s explicitly invited to access. Most teams will likely only give Hulia access to
                    mutually shared resources, like the team meeting room and public spaces.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    The next step will be to implement end-to-end encryption for all data, beginning with messages. This
                    is essential for privacy and security, protecting your data not just within your workspace but also
                    from external threats.
                </p>
                <h3 class="display-6 fw-bold mb-4">
                    2. Control at the hands of humans
                </h3>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    Hulia will be able to operate autonomously without the need for human supervision or prompting (and
                    she should perform her tasks even more effectively than if she were given explicit instructions).
                    However, Huly users will also be able to override Hulia’s actions and and manually customize her
                    permissions and automations to align with their team’s needs and preferences.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    After fine-tuning Hulia’s capabilities, Huly will also offer individual personalized AI assistants,
                    which will be customized by the user and will carry out various tasks on the user’s behalf. Personal
                    AI assistants will be tailored to the user’s own needs and preferences, rather than those set for
                    the workspace, allowing the assistant to perform actions based on the user’s information without
                    exposing their data to the rest of the team.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    The possibilities for personalized AI assistants in Huly are endless. To list a few:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mb-4">
                    <li class="list-group-item bg-black text-white">
                        Time-blocking: Your AI assistant will scan your messages and task lists to block time on your
                        personal calendar, helping you avoid double-booking and miscommunications.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item bg-black text-white">
                        Personalized note-taking: Your AI assistant will understand your schedule, priorities and
                        workload, and therefore will provide meeting notes contextualized just for you.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item bg-black text-white">
                        Generating document templates: Your AI assistant will learn from everything you’ve created to
                        generate document templates for recurring structures and topics.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item bg-black text-white">
                        Tracking resources: Your AI assistant will compile and update your own personal knowledge base
                        of links, files, and resources connected to you, keeping your most relevant resources on hand.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item bg-black text-white">
                        Accessibility: Your AI assistant will understand your preferences and accommodation requirements
                        and tailor your experience accordingly.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    While we still have plenty of work to do to bring Hulia up to speed before developing personalized
                    AI assistants, we feel closer than ever to bringing this vision to life. The foundation we’re
                    building with Hulia now is laying the groundwork for the Huly MetaBrain, the interwoven knowledge
                    network on which all AI capabilities will be powered.

                <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold mb-4">
                    The Huly MetaBrain
                </h2>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    Groundbreaking developments in AI technology are exciting, so it’s no wonder many are rushing to add
                    AI into their own applications and services. In fact, many of these tools can be quite useful,
                    especially in the area of productivity and work efficiency.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    However, there is often a feeling of separation between the user and the AI tool itself: The user
                    must first determine that there is a need for AI to perform a task; then, they must take some action
                    to initiate the AI (accepting a suggestion, for example, or writing a prompt). Finally, they may
                    need to take some final action to adapt the AI output to their own context.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    This type of AI add-on can be useful when the user clearly understands how to prompt the AI to
                    perform a desired task. However, there are two limitations with this type of tool:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mb-4">
                    <li class="list-group-item bg-black text-white">
                        Humans are not always good at recognizing their weaknesses, and many still do not accept that AI
                        can perform their tasks more effectively. Therefore, many users do not even think to reach for
                        an AI tool because they operate under the belief that they perform their tasks well enough on
                        their own.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item bg-black text-white">
                        Even with the right AI tool at their disposal, if users do not clearly understand how to
                        effectively prompt the AI for the desired result, the tool is essentially useless.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    With the Huly MetaBrain, we’re approaching these challenges from a new perspective. You’ll notice
                    that Hulia isn’t just another AI add-on or integration — she behaves just like any other user in
                    your workspace; only she will perform tasks much more effectively than her human counterparts. It
                    will be possible to prompt Hulia to take some action, but Hulia will also perform many tasks on her
                    own initiative, and the outcome will be far better than if she were limited by human prompting.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    The Huly MetaBrain connects every element of your workflow – tasks, documents, chats, and meetings –
                    to build a living, breathing knowledge base. As Hulia learns from your team’s activity, she will
                    transform this knowledge into actionable insights, recommendations, and automations.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    Because Hulia is woven into the Huly platform, she won’t ever feel like an external tool. She’ll be
                    part of your team, interwoven into your workflows, enhancing productivity without adding friction.

                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    As we continue to build on this foundation, the Huly MetaBrain will begin to redefine how teams
                    collaborate and innovate together. As Hulia’s capabilities expand, we’re excited to see her become
                    an indispensable member of your team, deeply understanding your work and offering natural and
                    intuitive support.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    Looking ahead, the combination of Hulia with individual personalized AI assistants will create more
                    than just a place to get work done — it will foster an ecosystem in which humans and AI assistants
                    collaborate harmoniously together, leveraging their own unique strengths to achieve even greater
                    ambitions. We’re excited for you to be a part of this journey!
