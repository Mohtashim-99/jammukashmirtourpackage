        "question":"What is the best time or season to visit Kashmir?",
        "answer":" Kashmir is a place to visit all the year round. It wears unique looks in all four seasons of the year, namely spring, summer, autumn and winter. In spring season, the valley looks multihued with flowers of vivid colors and varieties. Summer days are refreshing with lush green meadows while autumn season is characterized by fruit laden trees. Winter season is the best time to indulge in snow sports over snow clad valley. So, it would be better if you could visit Kashmir in all the four season to witness four different views of the valley which looks like a picture straight out of a fairytale. Otherwise, choose your favorite season to visit the valley at your convenience." ,
